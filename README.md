## 📡 Overview

## 🛠️ Technical Stack & Animations
This project pushes the boundaries of standard HTML/CSS templates by utilizing:

* Glassmorphism UI: Background blur levels set to 25px with a 0.05 opacity border for a "floating glass" effect.
* Intersection Observer API: All sections utilize a Scroll Reveal logic, sliding elements into view as the user scrolls.
* 3D Perspective Transforms: Link cards utilize perspective(1000px) and rotateX/Y logic to tilt toward the user's cursor in real-time.
* Parallax Vector Engine: Side-aligned SVG assets shift based on a coordinate calculation of the mouse position to create a sense of deep space.
